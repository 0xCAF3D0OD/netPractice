## ℹ️ What is a network protocol?

* In networking, **a `protocol` is a set of rules for formatting and processing data**. Network protocols are like a common 
language for computers. Computers on a network may use very different software and hardware, but **the use of protocols 
allows them to communicate with each other**.

* For example two people who do not speak the same language, one French and one German, would have a second language 
to understand each other, English.

* This is what happens with computers. If one computer uses the **Internet Protocol** `(IP)` and a second computer does too, 
**they can communicate**.

* But if one computer **uses** `IP` and the other **does not** know this protocol, they will n**ot be able to communicate**.

* **On the Internet, there are different protocols for different types of processes.** Protocols are often discussed in 
terms of the layer of the OSI model to which they belong.
