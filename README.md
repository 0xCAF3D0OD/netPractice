### ℹ️ What is a network protocol?

* In networking, **a `protocol` is a set of rules for formatting and processing data**. Network protocols are like a common 
language for computers. Computers on a network may use very different software and hardware, but **the use of protocols 
allows them to communicate with each other**.

* For example two people who do not speak the same language, one French and one German, would have a second language
