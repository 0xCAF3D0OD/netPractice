### üí≠ What is a network protocol?

* In networking, **a `protocol` is a set of rules for formatting and processing data**. Network protocols are like a common 
language for computers. Computers on a network may use very different software and hardware, but **the use of protocols 
allows them to communicate with each other**.

* For example two people who do not speak the same language, one French and one German, would have a second language 
to understand each other, English.

* **On the Internet, there are different protocols for different types of processes.** Protocols are often discussed in 
terms of the layer of the `OSI` model to which they belong.

### üí≠ What is the OSI model?

* The `OSI` (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract representation of how the Internet works.
* It is made up of 7 layers:

* Each layer representing a different category of networking functions, **the protocols make these networking 
functions possible**.
